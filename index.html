    <p class="tagline">Closing Cost Estimate Software for Florida Law Firms</p>

    <h2>What LexSheet Is</h2>
    <p>
      LexSheet is hosted software that provides a configurable closing cost estimation calculator
      for Florida real estate transactions. Law firms embed the calculator on their website so
      clients can generate estimated buyer and seller closing costs based on basic transaction details.
    </p>

    <p>
      LexSheet is software only. All calculations are estimates provided for informational purposes
      and do not constitute legal or financial advice.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      Firms embed the LexSheet calculator on their website using a secure license key.
      Users enter limited transaction details, and the calculator displays an estimated breakdown
      of customary closing costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculations are performed client-side. LexSheet does not process payments and does not store
      end-user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>
      LexSheet is offered on a licensed basis with a one-time setup fee and an ongoing subscription
      for hosted access, maintenance, and support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pricing varies by license count and billing term. Please contact us for details.

      </p>

      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        LexSheet does not collect or store personal information entered into the calculator.
        Calculations are performed client-side. Limited operational data may be collected solely
